*Kotlin opgave lavet af: Anders Kalhauge & Tobias Grundtvig* 

> The task is to create a web server which will use any class that implements a
simple interface as content. The interfaceâ€™s only jobs are to mark a class as
fit for web publishing and to provide a method, that tells the class to persist
its memory

**The content class should have functions corresponding to RESTful methods
and urls:**

*1: the url `/member` requested with the GET method corresponds to the
method `getMember():` `List<Member>`*

*2: the url `/member/<integer>` also with GET corresponds to `getMember(id:
Int):` `Member?`*
  
*3: the url `/member` requested with PUT and a JSON member in the body,
corresponds to `putMember(member: Member):` `Member`*
